## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Work

### High Priority

1. **Convert All Controllers** (24 remaining)
   - Secure.php (base controller - critical)
   - Auth.php (authentication - critical)
   - Dashboard.php

   - And 18 more...

2. **Convert All Models** (19+ remaining)

   - cmail library needs updating
   - Custom libraries in `application/libraries/` need migration

4. **Session Configuration**
   - Update session driver configuration
   - Verify session table structure compatibility

5. **Database Query Updates**
   - Update all query builder calls throughout application
   - Test all database operations

### Medium Priority

6. **Configuration Files**
   - Migrate custom config from `application/config/`
   - Update email configuration
   - Update tank_auth configuration

7. **Helpers**
   - Migrate custom helpers to `app/Helpers/`
   - Update helper function calls

8. **Testing**
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test database operations
   - Test all AJAX endpoints
   - Test file uploads
   - Test session management

## üìù Conversion Patterns

See `UPGRADE_GUIDE.md` for detailed conversion patterns for:
- Controllers
- Models
- Database queries
- Sessions
- Input/Output

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

1. **PHP Version**: CodeIgniter 4 requires PHP 8.1+. Ensure your server meets this requirement.

2. **tank_auth Library**: This is a third-party authentication library for CI3. You'll need to:
   - Find a CI4-compatible version, OR
   - Rewrite authentication using CI4's built-in features

3. **Database Compatibility**: The database structure should work, but all queries need to be updated to CI4 syntax.

4. **Old Files**: The original `application/` and `system/` folders are still present. These should be removed or backed up once migration is complete and tested.

5. **AJAX Calls**: Some AJAX calls may need URL updates if routing changes affect them.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Start with Authentication**:
   - Convert `Auth.php` controller
   - Convert tank_auth library or find alternative
   - Test login/logout flow

2. **Convert Base Controller**:
   - Convert `Secure.php` which is extended by many controllers
   - Update all child controllers to use new Secure controller

3. **Convert Core Models**:
   - PersonModel
   - AppointmentModel
   - PatientModel
   - Other frequently used models

4. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Convert one controller at a time
   - Test immediately after conversion
   - Fix issues before moving to next

## üìö Files Created

- `UPGRADE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed conversion guide with examples
- `MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - This file
- `app/` - New CI4 application directory
- `writable/` - Writable directories for CI4
- `.env` - Environment configuration
- Updated `index.php` - CI4 bootstrap
- Updated `composer.json` - CI4 dependencies

## üîç Testing Checklist

Once conversion is complete, test:
- [ ] User registration
- [ ] User login/logout
- [ ] Session persistence
- [ ] Database CRUD operations
- [ ] File uploads
- [ ] Email sending
- [ ] AJAX endpoints
- [ ] Form submissions
- [ ] Authentication middleware
- [ ] Permission checks
- [ ] All controller methods
- [ ] All views render correctly
